# Increment a Number with JavaScript


You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the `++` operator.

```javascript
i++;
```

is the equivalent of

```javascript
i = i + 1;
```

## Note
The entire line becomes `i++`;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

## Instructions
 - Change the code to use the ++ operator on myVar.
