# Decrement a Number with JavaScript
 
You can easily `decrement` or `decrease` a variable by one with the `--` operator.

```javascript
i--;
```

is the equivalent of

```javascript
i = i - 1;
```

## Note
The entire line becomes `i--;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

## Instructions 
 - Change the code to use the `--` operator on myVar.
