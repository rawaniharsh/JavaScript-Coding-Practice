# Shopping List

Create a shopping list in the variable `myList`. The list
should be a multi-dimensional array containing several sub-arrays.

The first element in each sub-array should contain a string
with the name of the item. The second element should be a number
representing the quantity i.e.

`["Chocolate Bar", 15]`

There should be at least 5 sub-arrays in the list.

### Before

```javascript
var myList = [];
```

### Answers

```javascript
var myList = [["Banana", 3], ["Apple", 4], ["Orange", 5], ["Peach", 6], ["Pineaple", 7]];
```

### Thinking

Here we just need to setup 5 sub-array and each array need to have a string
and a number. Pretty straight-forward.
