# Declare JavaScript Objects as Variables

Before we dive into `Object Oriented Programming`, let's revisit
JavaScript objects.

Give your `motorBike` object a wheels, engines and seats
 attribute and set them to numbers.

### Before

```javascript
var car = {
  "wheels":4,
  "engines":1,
  "seats":5
};

var motorBike = {

  // Only change code below this line.

};
```

### Answers

```javascript
var car = {
  "wheels":4,
  "engines":1,
  "seats":5
};

var motorBike = {

  "wheels": 2,
  "engines": 1,
  "seats": 1

};
```
